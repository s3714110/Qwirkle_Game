# APT_Qwirkle
This game implements an expanding board. If the player places a tile in a boundary row or column then the board will expand in that direciton. This leads to the board being uneven. The board will stop expanding in a specific direction if it reaches max width or max height. 

Max dimensions defined as:
Max height = 26
Max width = 26
